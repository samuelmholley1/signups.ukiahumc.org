**Subject:** New Online Signup System for Food Distribution Volunteers

Hi Trudy,

I hope you're doing well! I wanted to let you know that I've created a new online signup system for our Saturday food distribution volunteers. This should make coordinating volunteers much easier and reduce the back-and-forth emails.

**Website:** https://signups.ukiahumc.org/food-distribution  
**Password:** lovewins

I've already added you and 11 other regular volunteers to a dropdown menu in the signup form, so you can sign up with just a few clicks. If there's anyone missing from the list who regularly volunteers, just send me their name and email address and I'll add them right away.

I've also drafted a template email below that you can adapt and send to your volunteer group to introduce the new system. Feel free to edit it however you'd like, or let me know if you'd like me to adjust anything.

Please take a look at the template and let me know if it works for you!

Warmly,  
Samuel

## TEMPLATE EMAIL FOR YOUR VOLUNTEERS

**Subject:** New Online Signup System for Food Distribution Volunteers

Hi Food Distribution Volunteers,

We now have an easy online system for signing up to volunteer for our Saturday food distributions, allowing us to avoid back-and-forth group email exchanges. The system is first-come, first-served. You can always see who's signed up for a given Saturday in case you'd like to contact them and swap shifts.

**Website:** https://signups.ukiahumc.org/food-distribution  
**Password:** lovewins

**How it works:**
1. Visit the website and enter the password.
2. Browse available Saturdays (currently showing December 2025).
3. Click "Sign Up" for either Volunteer #1 or Volunteer #2.
4. Select your name from the dropdown menu.
5. You're done! The page updates in real-time and you'll receive an email confirmation.

**My ask:** Please sign up for at least one Saturday between now and the end of December if you're available. We need 2 volunteers for each distribution.

**Special features:**
• See who's already signed up for each date
• Cancel your own signup if plans change
• Your contact information is pre-filled when you select your name
• Works on phones, tablets, and computers

December Saturdays (6th, 13th, 20th, 27th) need volunteers! Please sign up today.
